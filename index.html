      <p><b>Problem that this app addresses:</b> Many people, ranging from teenagers in high school to those late in their working life, face many lifestyle issues ranging from lack of exercise to sleep deprivation. These stem from a variety of reasons, but one of the biggest causes is that there is not a large enough incentive for these people to create good habits.</p>
      
      <p><b>Habit RPG</b> is an app that provides a solution to alleviating those bad habits. By giving users an avatar and level that increases as the user starts to develop better habits, there is the added incentive of visual progression and the satisfaction of one-upping your measly level 5 friend. We believe that in utilizing the dopamine generated from such a reward system we are able to promote healthy habits and improve lives.</p>
